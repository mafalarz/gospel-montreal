          <p>
            For over a decade, we’ve asked thousands across our city a question
            that cuts to the core of human self-perception: “If you stood before
            God after death and He asked, ‘Why should I let you into My Heaven?’,
            what would you say?” The most frequent reply—“I’ve been a good
            person”—reflects a deeply held belief in moral sufficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the Oxford Dictionary, “good” means “to be desired or
            approved of,” yet when pressed, many acknowledge they don’t truly
            deserve Heaven. They often add, however, that they don’t feel or
            think they’re so morally or ethically corrupt as to warrant eternal
            punishment. This response reveals a universal tension: the instinct
            to seek approval while grappling with the weight of imperfection.

            <h2>No One Is Truly Good</h2>
          </header>

          <div class="section-quote">
            <p class="quote-text">“Why do you call me good?”</p>
            <p class="quote-attribution">— Jesus (Mark 10:18)</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            When a well-off man, desperate for spiritual assurance, ran to
            Jesus and addressed Him as “Good Teacher"<a href="#Mark10_17-18"><sup>1</sup></a>, Christ’s
            response was startling: “Why do you call me good? No one is good
            except God alone.”. This exchange challenges the modern assumption
            that moral virtue can be measured on a human scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jesus—the figure who healed the sick, uplifted the marginalized, and
            embodied selfless love—did not deflect praise out of humility but
            redefined the very nature of “goodness.” His words dismantle the
            notion that ethical behavior, however admirable, equates to divine
            perfection. If the One who personified love and justice refused to
            claim inherent goodness, what does this reveal about our own
            standards?
          </p>
          <p>
            Jesus’ statement exposes a chasm between human and divine goodness:
            the former is relative, temporal, and stained by imperfection, while
            the latter is absolute, eternal, and unattainable by human effort.
            This confrontation forces a choice: either we cling to the fragile
            illusion of our own moral sufficiency, or we recognize the radical
            call to seek a righteousness that transcends human achievement—a
            righteousness rooted not in our deeds but in surrender to the only
            One who truly satisfies the definition of “good.”
          </p>

          <div class="section-quote">
            <p class="quote-text">“Who, then, can be saved?”</p>
            <p class="quote-attribution">
              — Jesus’ disciples (Matthew 19:25)
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            The encounter between Jesus and that rich man crystallizes the
            futility of human<a href="#Matthew16_16-25"><sup>2</sup></a> moral effort when measured against
            God’s holiness. The man, confident in his adherence to the
            commandments, asks what “good thing” he must perform to inherit
            eternal life. Jesus responds not by affirming his moral résumé but
            by exposing its inadequacy: “Keep the commandments if you want to
            enter life,” then sharpens the blade, demanding the surrender of
            wealth and self-reliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the man walks away, Jesus declares, “It will be very hard for
            rich people to enter the Kingdom of heaven,” not as a condemnation
            of wealth itself but as a metaphor for the impossibility of
            salvation through human virtue. The disciples’ stunned question—“Who,
            then, can be saved?”—receives an answer that dismantles all
            self-assurance: “This is impossible for human beings, but for God
            everything is possible.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, Jesus confronts the illusion that moral sufficiency can be
            engineered through rules, rituals, or self-discipline. Even the most
            disciplined adherent to ethical codes—like that man, who claims to
            have kept the commandments—fails to grasp that God’s standard is not
            comparative righteousness but absolute perfection.
          </p>

          <p>
            This aligns with Jesus’ earlier declaration “that you will be able
            to enter the Kingdom of heaven only if you are more faithful than
            the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees in doing what God
            requires.”<a href="#Matthew5_20"><sup>3</sup></a>. The Pharisees were the pinnacle of human
            moral achievement—fastidious in law-keeping, tithing, and ceremonial
            purity—yet Jesus dismisses their righteousness as woefully
            insufficient. Why? Because God’s holiness is not a higher rung on
            the ladder of human morality but an entirely different dimension of
            existence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Law’s demands are not merely external (do not murder, do not
            commit adultery) but internal (do not hate, do not lust), revealing
            that even our thoughts and desires are tainted by rebellion<a href="#Matthew5_21-30"><sup>4</sup></a>.
            Every attempt to “be good” becomes a mirror exposing our corruption:
            we cannot even love our enemies, let alone achieve the selfless,
            radical generosity Jesus demands.
          </p>

          <div class="section-quote">
            <p class="quote-text">“You must be perfect”</p>
            <p class="quote-attribution">— Jesus (Matthew 5:48)</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            The tension reaches its breaking point when we recognize that God’s
            justice requires perfection<a href="#Matthew5_48"><sup>5</sup></a>—a standard no human can
            meet. Our moral efforts, however praiseworthy by earthly standards,
            are “filthy rags"<a href="#Isaiah64-6"><sup>6</sup></a> before His purity. This is the crisis
            Jesus amplifies: to cling to the myth of self-righteousness is to
            reject reality itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only rational response is to abandon all claims of moral
            adequacy and cry out for a righteousness not our own—one that cannot
            be earned, legislated, or self-generated, but must be received as a
            gift from the One who alone defines “good.”

            <h2>The Cross: God’s Perfect Substitute</h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            The climax of Jesus’ teachings leaves no room for ambiguity: human
            righteousness, however strenuous, cannot bridge the chasm between
            our sinfulness and God’s holiness. This reality is crystallized in
            His words during the Last Supper: “this is my blood, which seals
            God's covenant, my blood poured out for many for the forgiveness of
            sins.”<a href="#Matthew26_28"><sup>7</sup></a>. Here, Jesus explicitly declares that access to
            God’s presence—and the forgiveness required to enter it—depends not
            on human effort but on His sacrificial death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earlier, He had warned, “if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of
            Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves.”<a href="#John6_53"><sup>8</sup></a>—a
            statement so scandalous that many disciples abandoned Him<a href="#John6_66"><sup>9</sup></a>.
            Yet Jesus refused to soften it. Why? Because He alone is “the Lamb
            of God, who takes away the sin of the world!”<a href="#John1_29"><sup>10</sup></a>—the
            perfect substitute required to satisfy divine justice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cross was not a tragic accident but the fulfillment of God’s
            plan. Jesus’ cry from the cross—“My God, my God, why did you abandon
            me?”<a href="#Matthew27_46"><sup>11</sup></a>—reveals the horror of bearing the weight of
            humanity’s sin, a punishment we deserve but He endured. This is the
            heart of the gospel: “Christ was without sin, but for our sake God
            made him share our sin in order that in union with him we might
            share the righteousness of God.”<a href="#2Corinthians5_21"><sup>12</sup></a>. Our moral inadequacy
            is not a hurdle to overcome through self-improvement but a death
            sentence requiring a Substitute.

          </div>

          <p>
            Jesus’ resurrection three days later vindicates His claim: “I am the
            resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me will live, even
            though they die;”<a href="#John11_25"><sup>13</sup></a>. There is no other name, no other
            sacrifice, no other righteousness that can grant access to Heaven—only
            the blood of the One who alone defined “good,” who alone conquered
            death, and who alone offers eternal life to those who abandon
            self-righteousness and surrender to Him.
          </p>

          <p>
            The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the definitive, historical event
            that seals the truth of His claims and dismantles every competing
            worldview. Unlike the founders of other religions—Buddha, Muhammad,
            or Confucius—whose tombs remain occupied, Jesus’ tomb is empty. The
            Gospels record that after His crucifixion, Roman guards sealed the
            tomb<a href="#Matthew27_62-66"><sup>14</sup></a>, yet three days later, it was found open, His body
            gone, and angels declared, “He is not here; he has been raised”<a href="#Luke24_26"><sup>15</sup></a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the next 40 days, He appeared to more than 500 witnesses<a href="#1Corinthians15_6"><sup>16</sup></a>,
            including skeptics like Thomas<a href="#John20_24-29"><sup>17</sup></a> and enemies like
            Paul<a href="#Acts9_1-15"><sup>18</sup></a>, transforming them into unshakable proclaimers of
            His resurrection—even unto death. This is not myth or metaphor; it
            is history’s most radical claim, corroborated by the sudden,
            explosive growth of the early Church in Jerusalem, where Jesus’
            resurrection could have been disproven by producing His corpse.
          </p>

          <p>
            The resurrection validates every prior assertion of Jesus’ divinity
            and authority. When He declared, “I am the resurrection and the
            life. Those who believe in me will live, even though they die”<a href="#John11_25"><sup>19</sup></a>,
            He staked His identity on the power to conquer death—a power no
            human or religious leader has ever wielded. His resurrection proves
            He is not merely a moral teacher but the incarnate God who fulfilled
            the Law’s demands<a href="#Matthew5_17"><sup>20</sup></a>, bore sin’s penalty<a href="#Romans5_8"><sup>21</sup></a>, and
            rose to justify all who trust in Him<a href="#Romans4_25"><sup>22</sup></a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            It also exposes the futility of human moral striving: if salvation
            could be earned through good deeds, Jesus’ death and resurrection
            would be unnecessary<a href="#Galatians2_21"><sup>23</sup></a>. Instead, the empty tomb proclaims
            that only His sacrifice suffices. Every religion or philosophy that
            rejects the resurrection—whether denying His death (Islam),
            redefining His divinity (Jehovah’s Witnesses), or prioritizing human
            works (secularism)—collapses under the weight of this fact: their
            leaders are dead, but our Savior lives.
          </p>

          </header>

          <p>
            The gospel calls for more than agreement; it calls
            for surrender. The biblical response is to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Turn</strong> from self-righteousness and sin, admitting
              that you cannot save yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trust</strong> in Jesus Christ alone—His life, death, and
              resurrection—as your righteousness and hope.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Follow</strong> Him as Lord, learning to love God and
              others in the power of His Spirit.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you are wrestling with these truths, we encourage you to open a
            Bible, read the Gospel of John, and ask God to reveal Himself to
            you. You are also welcome to reach out to a Bible-believing church
            or to us at Gospel Montreal to talk and pray.
